### Comparison with Baseline in Yosys0.9

To ensure a fair comparison with the baseline, we conducted experiments using the same older version of Yosys as Verismith. Below are the key findings:

#### Experiment Setup
- **Tool Versions**: We used the same older version of Yosys as Verismith for consistency.
- **Test Cases**: 500 test cases were executed.

#### Results
- **Verismith**: Found **0 inconsistencies**.
- **LLM4Ver (Proposed)**: Detected **54 inconsistencies** (some of which are repetitive issues, such as state transitions), where the RTL and netlist produced different outputs.We will provide confirmed bug designs after detailed analysis.
